# Introduction
# string concatenation (aka how to put strings together)
# suppose we want to create a string that says "subscribe to _____ "
# 3 ways to do string concatention

# Example:
# youtuber = input("Name of a youtuber:") # some string variable
# print("subscribe to " + youtuber) #way1-good for short string
# print("subscribe to {}".format(youtuber)) #way2
# print(f"subscribe to {youtuber}") #way3- good for long passages of strings

# Creating a Madlib using way3:
adj = input("Adjective: ")
verb1 = input("Verb: ")
verb2 = input("Verb: ")
famous_person = input("Famous person: ")

madlib = f"Computer programming is so {adj}! It makes me so excited all the time because \
I love to {verb1}. Stay hydrated and {verb2} like you are {famous_person}!"

print(madlib)
